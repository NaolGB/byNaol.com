    Hi there, I am Naol Basaye. An udnergraduate senior studying Data Science at Duke University and Duke Kunshan University.
    My interdisciplinary major gives me skills and knowledge both in Computer Science and Statistics. 
    I am a Full Stack Software Engineer and Curious Data Scientist expereinced through internships,
    jobs, and projects.
    <br>
    <br>
    My goal is to become a leader in the tech and business space. As such I am looking for opportunities where
    I can grow as a developer, team leader, and manager. Having impact in my job gives my work life a meaning.
    Be it big or small, I want what I work on to have an impact on others.
    <br>
    <br>
    I spend my free time working on projects that excite me, solve problems I see around. This has led me to 
    learn multiple technologies and programming languages. It is a truly enjoyable feeling when one learns to 
    do something and becomes able to solve problems - it is as if <strong>it is all in your hands!</strong> In addition to tech 
    based projects, I find graphic designing and video production to be an enjoyable hobby.
    You can find some of my videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwIzNRT90YiHWV6gaLLoE8w">here on YouTube</a>. 
    <br>

    I would love to hear from you. Hit me up on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/naol-basaye/'>LinkedIn</a>.
