<p>
    Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is a computer game to measure risk taking 
    behavior of players. It is used by researchers and employers to determine, among 
    others, risk propensity. While there are multiple implementations of BART, 
    there is a lack of implementations where researchers can record data other than just 
    number of pumps or clicks.

    Using Django, I was able to record multiple forms of data more than clicks. I further developed this
    into active inference which helped me analyze player behaviour with better quantifyability.
